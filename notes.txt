Your life is currency
=====================

Factorio-inspired game... (but it doesn't fit the theme! :(

Start with sum of money
Can research building blocks:

- producer - pick type of raw material + qtty
- delivery - sells end product
- forge - transforms raw material into plates, or plates into steel
- belt - moves elements around
- container - serves as buffer
- assembly - transforms several objects into final or subproduct
- inserter - takes things from one place to another
- splitter - splits into 2 lanes
- filter - filters into 2 lanes

Resources:
- copper => copper plates
- gold => gold plates
- sand => silicon plates
- iron => iron plates

Assembly:
2 copper => copper wire
2 gold => gold wire
5 silicon plates => transistor
2 copper + 1 copper wire => resistor
2 iron plates => iron gear
2 gold plates => gold gear
3 gold gear + 3 iron gear => Logical Unit
3 transistor + 2 resistor + 2 iron plates => PSU
2 LU + gold wire + 2 transistor => hard drive
3 gold wire + 3 transistor => RAM
4 transistor + 4 resistor + 2 silicon plates => CPU
3 CPU + 2 RAM + Logical Unit => Motherboard
Motherboard + Monitor + Video card => Computer
3 Computer + 2 Motherboard => Robot
5 Computers + 4 Robots + 3 LU => Spacecraft
